📦 Amazon Clone – HTML & CSS

A clean and structured Amazon Clone built using pure HTML and CSS.
This project helped me understand how real-world websites structure their layout, use components, and organize sections like navbars, hero banners, product grids, and footers.
Perfect practice for strengthening fundamentals and writing clean, readable code. ✨
